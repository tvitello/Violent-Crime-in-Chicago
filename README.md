# Violent-Crime-in-Chicago

Final deliverable for the "Data Visualization with Tableau Project" course on Coursera, part 5 of 5 for the Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization curriculum.

In this study, students were asked to source their own publically available data from the web.  Here, data from data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Map/c4ep-ee5m was used, subset to only the year 2020.  Due to file size constraints on GitHub, the .CSV file included in this repo is further subset to values where "Arrests == True", as the Tableau dashboard only considers that condition anyway.

Said dashboard provides user interaction with regard to dynamic filtering by arrest type, location, and date, for the city of Chicago.  I broke the city down into three geographic regions (North, Central, and South).  Crimes in this context are only "violent" crimes as defined by FBI Codes 01A, 02, 03, 04A, and 04B.

This dashboard is also available on my Tableau Public page here:
